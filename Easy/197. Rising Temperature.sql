id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 

Write an SQL query to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |

-- solution 1:
select w2.Id
from weather w1, weather w2
where w2.recordDate = Date_add(w1.recordDate, Interval 1 day) and w2.Temperature > w1.Temperature

-- solution 2:
select w1.id
from weather w1, weather w2
where w1.temperature > w2.temperature and
    to_days(w1.recorddate) - to_days(w2.recorddate) = 1
